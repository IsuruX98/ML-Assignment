# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction ✈️

This project applies supervised machine learning algorithms to predict airline passenger satisfaction using a real-world dataset from Kaggle.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction)
- The dataset contains details such as passenger type, flight class, in-flight service ratings, and satisfaction status (satisfied or neutral/dissatisfied).

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

We applied four different supervised machine learning algorithms to classify passenger satisfaction:

1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **Random Forest**

Each model was trained, tested, and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🧪 Methodology

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Feature selection and encoding
3. Model training and hyperparameter tuning
4. Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report
5. Comparison of model performance

## 📈 Results

A comparison of algorithm performance based on key evaluation metrics is provided in the project report (see `Report.pdf`).
